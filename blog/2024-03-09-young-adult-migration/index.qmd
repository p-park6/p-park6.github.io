# Introduction

The intention of this blog post is to show the steps I took to create my final infographic piece. This blog will detail the steps I took to create each infographic piece. I'll also detail how I did my preliminary analysis of the data to help shape the questions I asked. This dataset, found on [migrationpatterns.org](www.migrationpatterns.org), details where young adults are from and where they choose to move to for their adult portion of their lives. This blog also serves to integrate key components of what makes an inforgraphic strong in each visualization. I also hopes that this helps inspire you to create your own infographic as well!

# Questions in question

For this project, I was curious in looking into migration patterns with in the US. I wasn’t too sure what aspect I wanted to look at with this question, so I began looking at various datasets. Looking through the datasets that offer information on where people moved, I stumbled across a dataset detailing the migration patterns of young adults. Being a young adult myself, I am interested to look at where those moved when they were my age. From this, I decided to ask the overarching question: “From what cities are young Adults moving to Los Angeles?”. I’ll be answering this main question by asking a number of subset questions: 
**1. Where in the map are they coming from? (Map visualization)**
**2. About how many people from the cities are moving to Los Angeles? (Lollipop Visualization)**
**3. How does the total amount of these people that are moving from those cities compare to the population that are already living in Los Angeles? (bar graph visualization)**


# Datasets of interest

The [dataset](https://data.migrationpatterns.org/MigrationPatternsData.zip) I am using is provided by the United States Census Bureau, which the data was then explored and wrangled by researchers from Harvard University and the US Census Bureau. This data was then used for a project hosted on migrationpatterns.org to look at where young people are moving to see the potential impacts on the labor market. Here, the user can filter by income, race, or all together. Users can also hover over each county and get additional information of the amount of people that is coming to or from that county. However, when using the web interface, understanding the information shown is not very intuitive. I wanted to find a way to show this information in a more streamlined way, in which, this infographic was born.

This dataset that I downloaded came with four datasets. One dataset includes information on where the individuals have moved to separated by type of race. The second dataset includes information of where the individuals have moved to separated by income. The third dataset gets the two (race and income) and separates it by where the individual falls. For example if the individual was Asian and was in middle class, that is how they would be classified in the dataset. The fourth dataset does not separate the data by a certain factor and only states where the individual is from and where they ended up.


## Data Exploration (or what's important about this dataset?)
Before starting this project, I did a good amount of data exploration to understand what the data meant and what each column was representing. This dataset came with a metadata sheet that helped me understand what each column heading meant. However, the metadata was written in such a complex manner that it took me a couple of weeks to understand what it all meant.

![](metadata.png){fig-alt="Image shows portion of text of what the metadata looks like."}

Shown here is a snippit of what the metadata looks like. After a couple of readings through the metadata and doing my own research, I realized what each column header stood for in the datasets and how to use each column to accurately show the numbers.

## Data Wrangling (basically shaping the data)
Not much wrangling was done for this project as most of the data process was done by the researchers end. I did, however, had to add other datasets to get the information I needed in order to create my perfect infographic. These are the steps I took to shape the data:

```{r, eval = false, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, code-fold: true}
#load in libraries
library(tidyverse)
library(states)
library(maps)
library(patchwork)
library(scales)
library(showtext)


#load in data
od_pooled <- read_csv("data/od_pooled.csv") #dataset technically not 'separated' by a specific factor

# Most popular cities not separated by a certain factor
top_ten_pooled <- od_pooled %>% #using od_pooled
  select(o_cz_name, o_state_name, d_cz_name, d_state_name, n, n_tot_o, pool) %>%#select columns we are interested in, helps get rid of repeats
  filter(d_cz_name == "Los Angeles") %>% 
  distinct() %>% #gets rid of repeats in the dataset
  slice_max(n, n = 10) %>%  #find the top 10 most popular cities if applicable
  left_join(state_info, by = "o_state_name") %>%  #left join with state_info dataset to get regions of each state
  mutate(n_formatted = number(n, big.mark = ",")) %>% 
  #add coordinates to dataset to be able to map correctly
  mutate(long = c(-118, -117, -122, -121, -88, -121, -112, -115, -122, -74),
         lat = c(34, 33, 37, 38, 42, 37, 33, 36.3, 47, 40.5),
         la_long = c(-118.001, -118, -118, -118, -118, -118, -118, -118, -118, -118),
         la_lat = c(34, 34, 34, 34, 34, 34, 34, 34, 34, 34)
  )

#create new column that joins two columns and take out San Jose
top_ten_pooled <- top_ten_pooled %>% 
  unite("city_state", o_cz_name, state.abb, sep = "-", remove = FALSE)%>% 
  filter(city_state != "San Jose-CA")


#view wrangled dataset: uncomment to view dataset
#View(top_ten_pooled)
```


# Creating the infographics (aka where the magic happens)

## Visual 1, Map
The first visual I will be creating is the map portion of the infographic. Because my question hinges on which cities have the most migration to Los Angeles, it's important that the reader is able to understand what is going on when looking at it for the first 5 seconds. Below is the code and finish product I made to get the product I wanted:

```{r, eval = false, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, code-fold: true}
#create first color palette
col_pal_9 <- c("black", "#0C3A0C", "#135913", "#187218", "#1D8C1D", "#20AC20", "#2ADB2A", "#48FE48", "#8AED8A")

#create second color palette
col_pal_8 <- c("#0C3A0C", "#135913", "#187218", "#1D8C1D", "#20AC20", "#2ADB2A", "#8AED8A", "#9BD69B")
```

I started off by created the two color palettes that I'll be using for the whole dataset. This lets me get the color palette finished and also that I will not have to repeat the same text of code over and over. After setting my color palette, I went ahead and started building my map.

```{r, eval = false, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, code-fold: true}
map <- top_ten_pooled %>% #piping from top_ten_pooled
  ggplot(aes(long, lat)) + #have aes as long (x) and lat (y)
  borders("state", col="grey30", fill="gainsboro") + #create map
  geom_curve(aes(x=long, y=lat, xend=la_long, yend=la_lat, color = o_cz_name), #create ling segment
             curvature = 0.1, 
             alpha = 0.8, 
             linewidth = 2, 
             color = col_pal_9) +
  geom_point(color=ifelse(top_ten_pooled$city_state %in% c("Los Angeles-CA"), "#2d4c75", "black"), 
             size = 3, 
             color = "black") + #create points and specify what color the LA point is verses for the others
  coord_quickmap() #graph map
```

All this code above is to create the basis of the map and its relevant parts. Because I wanted to add labels onto the map to specify which city the points were representing, I used the function `geom_label` per city to help adjust where each label went. Because I did this function 9 times, I'll just add one example of what I did to achieve this task:

```{r, eval = false, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, code-fold: true}
  #San Digeo------
geom_label(aes(label = ifelse(city_state %in% 
                                c("San Diego-CA"), top_ten_pooled$o_cz_name, NA)),
           fill = "white",
           color = "black",
           alpha = 1, 
           size = 5, 
           force = 3,
           show.legend = FALSE,
           point.padding = 3,
           nudge_y = -1.1,
           nudge_x = 1,
           arrow = arrow(length = unit(1, "cm")),
           max.overlaps = 20) 
```

After, I went ahead and changed up the theme to make it very minimal for my final output:

```{r, eval = false, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, code-fold: true}
  theme_void() + #have theme as void
  #create theme to change layout of plot
  theme(
    legend.text = element_blank(),
    legend.background = element_blank(),
    legend.title = element_blank(),
    legend.key = element_blank(),
    legend.position = "none",
    plot.background = element_rect(fill='transparent'),
    plot.title = element_text(family = "merri", size = 25, color = "#201B22", hjust = 0),
    plot.subtitle = element_text(family = "merri", face = "italic", size = 15, color = "#201B22", hjust = 0),
    plot.margin = margin(r = 45, l = 45),
    panel.border = element_blank(),
    panel.background = element_blank()
  )
```

![](map.png){fig-alt="Image shows map of United States with green lines from various cities coming toward Los Angeles."}

And here is my final product for visualization 1! A simple but easy to understand map of which cities people are moving from to go to Los Angeles

## Visual 2: Lollipop Graph

I wanted the audience to understand how many people were coming from these cities to Los Angeles. To show this, I decided to create a lollipop graph to let the audience see which cities were more likely to move to Los Angeles.

```{r, eval = false, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, code-fold: true}
#Graph two: amount of people moving to Los Angeles
top_ten_lolli <- top_ten_pooled %>% #piping from top_ten_pooled
  mutate(d_cz_name = forcats::fct_reorder(city_state, desc(n))) %>% #rearrange order
  filter(city_state != "Los Angeles-CA") %>% #filter by taking out Los Angeles
  ggplot(aes(x = city_state, #create the aes
             y = n)) +
  geom_segment(aes(x=d_cz_name, xend=d_cz_name, y=0, yend=n), #specify the length of each stick
               size = 5, 
               alpha = 1,
               color = col_pal_8) +
  geom_point(size= 10, #specify where the points are located on the graph
             color= "#176417", 
             fill=alpha("#8AD78A", 0.3), alpha=0.7, shape=21, stroke=2) +
  geom_text(aes(label = n_formatted), vjust = -1.8, family = "merri", size = 6) + #add text showing the amount per lollipop graph
  scale_y_continuous(expand = expansion(mult = c(0, 0.1))) +
  # Theme edits:
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(family = "merri", color = "grey30", size = 15, angle = 45, vjust = 1, hjust= 1), #change x axis font
        axis.text.y = element_blank(), #take out y axis text
        axis.title.y = element_blank(), #take out y axis title
        panel.background = element_rect(fill='transparent', color = NA), #change background of graph to transparent
        panel.grid = element_blank(), #take out grid
        axis.title.x = element_blank(), #take out x axis title
        axis.ticks = element_blank(), #take out tick marks
        plot.margin = margin(l = 20), #extend the left margin out
        plot.background = element_rect(fill = "transparent", color = NA) #make background transparent
  ) 

```

![](top_ten_lolli.png){fig-alt="Image shows lollipop graph of how many people moved away from said city towards Los Angeles."}

Here, the code was not as complex as the code for the map. In this visualization, I used the `theme()` function to my advantage to get rid of any parts of the graph that I thought was unnecessary toward the final iteration of the infographic. The audience can also clearly see the amount of people that moved away per city.


## Visual 3: Bar Graph

My third infographic I created was a bar graph comparing the young adults that were already living in Los Angeles to the total amount of people that moved towards Los Angeles. To fully create this visualization, I created two bar graphs, one to represent Los Angeles, and on to represent all other cities combined which is represented as a stacked bar plot. Below is the code I created to achieve this visual:

```{r, eval = false, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, code-fold: true}
#subset for only LA observation
la_pooled <- top_ten_pooled[1,]

#subset for all other observations
migrate_pooled <- top_ten_pooled[2:9,] %>%
  mutate(combined = "Cities Combined",
         total_combined = "Total Population of Cities",
         total = sum(top_ten_pooled$n))
```

```{r, eval = false, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, code-fold: true}
#create bar graph for LA population
la_bar <- ggplot(data = la_pooled, aes(x = city_state, y = n)) + #specify what datasets and aes I want to look at
  geom_col(width = 0.5, fill = "#1A4075") + #specify width of bar
  scale_y_continuous(limits = c(0, 1800000)) + #set y axis to be consistent with other graph
  geom_text(aes(label = n_formatted), vjust = -0.7) + #create a text label to show total population of LA
  #edit theme to preference
  theme(
    panel.background = element_blank(), #take out panel
    axis.title.x = element_blank(), #take out x axis title
    axis.title.y = element_blank(), #take out y axis title
    plot.title.position = "plot", #reposition plot title
    axis.text.y = element_blank(), #take out y axis text
    axis.text.x = element_text(size = 13), #change x axis font size
    axis.ticks.y = element_blank(), #take out y axis ticks
    axis.ticks.x = element_blank(), #take out x axis ticks
    plot.background = element_rect(fill='transparent', color = NA), #make transparent
    panel.border = element_blank(), #take out panel
    panel.grid = element_blank(), #take out grid
    plot.margin = margin(r = 1) #shift right side margin
  )


#create bar graph on combined cities population
bot_cities_bar_controlled_y <- ggplot() +
  geom_col(data = migrate_pooled, aes(fill = city_state, y = n, x = combined), width = 0.5, position = position_stack(vjust = 1), fill = col_pal_8) + #create columns to make them stack on top of each other
  scale_y_continuous(limits = c(0, 1800000)) +  #set y axis to be consistent with other graph
  guides(fill=guide_legend(title="Cities")) + #set titles 
  annotate("text", x = 1, y=160000, label = "85,286") + #add label to show total combined population
  #edit theme as before
  theme(
    panel.background = element_blank(),
    axis.title.y = element_blank(),
    axis.title.x = element_blank(),
    plot.background = element_rect(fill='transparent', color=NA),
    axis.text.y = element_blank(),
    axis.text.x = element_text(size = 13),
    legend.title = element_text(size = 25),
    legend.text = element_text(size = 20),
    axis.ticks.y = element_blank(),
    axis.ticks.x = element_blank(),
    legend.position = "none",
    panel.border = element_blank(),
    panel.grid = element_blank()
  )

#combine the bar graphs with patchwork
combined_bar <- (la_bar + bot_cities_bar_controlled_y) +
  plot_annotation(theme = theme(plot.background = element_rect(fill='transparent', color=NA)))
```

![](combined_bar.png){fig-alt="Image shows two bar graphs, left is amount of young adults that stayed in Los Angeles, colored in blue, right is amount of young adults that moved to Los Angeles from said cities combined."}

To fully create this infographic, I used the package `patchwork` to stitch together these two bar graphs with each other to get an easily comparable visualization between the two bars. Something of interest to note here is that the combination of all cities combined is not even 1/10 of Los Angeles's population that decided to stay there. It also shows the sheer size of the population of Los Angeles.

## Finished product

![](eds_240_infographic.png){fig-alt="Image shows an infographic detailing from what cities young adults are moving to Los Angeles. Towards the middle top of the graph, a map shows from what cities they are migrating to Los Angeles. On the left side below the map is a lollipop graph showing how many people migrated towareds Los Angeles. On the right side below the map is a bar graph comparing LA young people population with those that are migrating there from the cities of interest."}

And here is our final product! After exporting the created visuals and using an online editing platform I was able to show my visualization here with additional explanations on what each visualizaton represents.
